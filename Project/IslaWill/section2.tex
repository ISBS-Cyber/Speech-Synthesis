\begin{frame}{How feasible is it to make an accurate voice representation with few voice samples?}

Five minutes of speech can yield a MOS as high as 3.97, and a speaker similarity MOS of 4.25 \cite{zhou2024thu}.

No. of samples may be more than some affected individuals may actually have.

Limited means of reducing potential long silences and scratching sounds \cite{peng2024voicecraft}.

Can be somewhat improved by training with Human Feedback \cite{chen2024humanfeedback}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Challenge: Is similarity to the affected individual's voice samples always ideal?}

Given the nature of MND, an individual may be unlikely to have sufficient speech recordings \cite{ieee2018mnd}.

Late sampling can result in “partial dysarthric pronunciation patterns incorporated into the reconstructed speech”.

Can be mitigated by fine-tuning, but there's no guarantee users will find product expressive.

There is somewhat of a trade-off between naturalness and speaker similarity.

\begin{frame}{Challenge: Is speech synthesis reliably accessible to users?}

To use a speech synthesis model offline, a GPU is often needed \cite{mandeel2022speaker}.

StreamSpeech uses just one CPU core, at cost of lower MCD \cite{ieee2018streams}.

Not appropriate for current use, but a proof of future concept.

\begin{frame}{Solution: Use of Concepts like Transfer Learning}

Transfer Learning is a process where knowledge gained through one task or dataset is used to enhance the models performance for a related task \cite{torrey2010transfer}. 

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was standard for most early work in speech synthesis and voice banking.

Neural TTS is newer, though it requires more data than HMM, it also possesses an increased naturalness.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Solution: Development of Naturalness in Newer Models}

Naturalness - how closely a TTS speech mimics a humans, more qualitative measure than accuracy which is measured in MOS.

Tacotron 2 - has already been applied and used by those with MND and Dysarthria.

Neural HMM - proposed altered model of Tacotron 2, requires less data and has great potential for those with MND.
