\begin{frame}{What is Speech Synthesis}
% comment time

\begin{itemize}
  \item Studies show that up to 1\% of the world's population - almost 8 and a half million people - suffer from a degree or speech, language, or communication lead \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}
  \item Speech Synthesis allows the direct translation of written text to human language, permitting a greater quality of life and more accessibility for those who may need the technology
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How does Speech Synthesis Work?}
% In the past, people who were loosing their voice would use methods such as Message Banking, Voice Banking, and Digital Legacy to preserve their voice
In the past, people who were loosing their voice would have to use more crude methods \cite{nhsPowerpoint}. However these have problems: they are limited in scope, and people who were unable to communicate in the first place cannot make use of them.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modern Speech Synthesis is made up of 3 key components \cite{tan2021survey}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Text Analysis module that extracts linguistic features from the given text
        \item The Acoustic Model that then translates them into acoustic features
        \item The Vocoder that finally synthesizes the waveform from those features
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How does this impact accessibility in the internet age?}
There are many incredible technologies being developed at the moment for accessibility, such as eye tracking\cite{elsahar2019augmentative} which allows the control of the system using just a user's eyes.

Even in the rare case that someone looses control of both eyes, which is most common in conditions such as Sixth Nerve Palsy\cite{sixthNervePalsy}, there are still options like breath control.


This ensures speech synthesis is always a viable option.
