\begin{frame}{What is MND Voice Loss, and how can Speech Synthesis Help}
% comment time

\begin{itemize}
  % Almost 8.5 million people
  % \item Studies show that up to 1\% of the world's population suffer from a degree or speech, language, or communication lead \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}
  % \ % permitting a greater quality of life and more accessibility for those who may need the technology
  \item Motor Neurone Disease (MND) can cause patients to loose the ability to speak cleary or at all
  \item This can manifest through muscle weakness or in changes to gesture and facial expressions \cite{MNDSpeech}
  \item Speech Synthesis allows the direct translation of written text to human language
  \item This can help to promote a greater quality of life for patients with MND
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How does Speech Synthesis Work?}
% In the past, people who were loosing their voice would use methods such as Message Banking, Voice Banking, and Digital Legacy to preserve their voice
There were two main problems with Speech Synthesis in the past\cite{nhsPowerpoint}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Limited in Scope
  \item Unusable for people who never had a voice
\end{itemize}

Modern Speech Synthesis is made up of three key components \cite{tan2021survey}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Text Analysis module %that extracts linguistic features from the given text
  \item The Acoustic Model %that then translates them into acoustic features
  \item The Vocoder %that finally synthesizes the waveform from those features
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How does this impact accessibility in the internet age?}
There are many technologies being developed at the moment for accessibility, such as eye tracking \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}. %which allows the control of the system using just a user's eyes.

This is beneficial to patients with MND, which can affect mobility and movement \cite{NHSMND}


Technology such as this ensures speech synthesis is always a viable option.
