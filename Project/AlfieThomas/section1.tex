\begin{frame}{What is Speech Synthesis}
% comment time

\begin{itemize}
  % Almost 8.5 million people
  \item Studies show that up to 1\% of the world's population suffer from a degree or speech, language, or communication lead \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}
  \item Speech Synthesis allows the direct translation of written text to human language % permitting a greater quality of life and more accessibility for those who may need the technology
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Speech Synthesis}

Speech Synthesis is a means by which a computer creates speech from a given text input. \cite{tan2021survey}

\item A modern Speech Synthesis model is made up of three key components: \cite{tan2021survey}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item The Text Analysis module %that extracts linguistic features from the given text
      \item The Acoustic Model %that then translates them into acoustic features
      \item The Vocoder %that finally synthesizes the waveform from those features
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Quality of synthesised speech improved by use of neural networks. \cite{tan2021survey}

\begin{frame}{How does this impact accessibility in the internet age?}
There are many incredible technologies being developed at the moment for accessibility, such as eye tracking \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}. %which allows the control of the system using just a user's eyes.

In the rare case that someone can't use either eye, such as from Sixth Nerve Palsy\cite{sixthNervePalsy}, there are still options like breath control.


This ensures speech synthesis is always a viable option.
