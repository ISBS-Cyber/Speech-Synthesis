  % Almost 8.5 million people
  \item Studies show that up to 1\% of the world's population suffer from a degree or speech, language, or communication lead \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}
  \item Speech Synthesis allows the direct translation of written text to human language % permitting a greater quality of life and more accessibility for those who may need the technology

% In the past, people who were loosing their voice would use methods such as Message Banking, Voice Banking, and Digital Legacy to preserve their voice
There were two main problems with voice replacement in the past:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited in Scope
    \item Unusable for people who never had a voice

  \item Modern Speech Synthesis is made up of three key components \cite{tan2021survey}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Text Analysis module %that extracts linguistic features from the given text
        \item The Acoustic Model %that then translates them into acoustic features
        \item The Vocoder %that finally synthesizes the waveform from those features
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There are many incredible technologies being developed at the moment for accessibility, such as eye tracking \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}. %which allows the control of the system using just a user's eyes.

In the rare case that someone can't use either eye, such as from Sixth Nerve Palsy\cite{sixthNervePalsy}, there are still options like breath control.


This ensures speech synthesis is always a viable option.
