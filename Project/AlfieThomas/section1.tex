\begin{frame}{Introduction: MND and Speech Impairment}
    \begin{block}{About MND \cite{nhs2025motor}:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item MND or Motor Neuron Disease is an incurable and eventually fatal disease. %that can affect anyone at any age, although it typically affects those older than 50. 
            \item Caused by a person's motor neurons failing. 
            \item It affects:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Mobility and movement.
                \item Breathing, swallowing, eating and drinking.
                \item Emotions, feelings, thoughts and behavior. 
                \item Speech and communication (focus for today).
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{How it affects speech:}
        MND can cause speech to become faint, slurred, or unclear. \cite{leveque2022acoustic} Speech synthesis systems provide an alternative to those losing their speech. %eventually speech becomes impossible.

\begin{frame}{Introduction: Speech Synthesis}
    \begin{block}{Definition:}
        Speech Synthesis is a means by which a computer creates speech from a given text input. \cite{tan2021survey}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Model Components:}
        A modern Speech Synthesis model is made up of three key components: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Text Analysis module %that extracts linguistic features from the given text
            \item The Acoustic Model %that then translates them into acoustic features
            \item The Vocoder %that finally synthesizes the waveform from those features
        \end{itemize}
        Quality of synthesised speech improved by use of neural networks.

\begin{frame}{Introduction: Applying speech synthesis to aid those affected by MND.}
    \begin{block}{Personalised Models:}
        Bespoke Speech Synthesis models can be trained on voice recordings to replicate speech in a certain voice.\cite{arik2018neural}
        A process known as “Voice Banking”.\cite{yamagishi2012speech}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Impact and Control:}
        “An individual voice rather than a generic one is part of your identity and maybe that will make you treated more as more of an individual rather than the generic voice generated by machine”\cite{cave2020voice}
        Synthesised speech production can be controlled by alternative input devices - i.e. eye trackers. \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}.
