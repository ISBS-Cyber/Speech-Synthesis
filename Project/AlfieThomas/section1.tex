\begin{frame}{What is Speech Synthesis}
% comment time

\begin{itemize}
  % Almost 8.5 million people
  \item Studies show that up to 1\% of the world's population suffer from a degree or speech, language, or communication lead \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}
  \item Speech Synthesis allows the direct translation of written text to human language % permitting a greater quality of life and more accessibility for those who may need the technology
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How does Speech Synthesis Work?}
% In the past, people who were loosing their voice would use methods such as Message Banking, Voice Banking, and Digital Legacy to preserve their voice
There were two main problems with voice replacement in the past:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited in Scope
    \item Unusable for people who never had a voice

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modern Speech Synthesis is made up of three key components \cite{tan2021survey}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Text Analysis module %that extracts linguistic features from the given text
        \item The Acoustic Model %that then translates them into acoustic features
        \item The Vocoder %that finally synthesizes the waveform from those features
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Bespoke Speech Synthesis models can be trained on voice recordings to replicate speech in a certain voice.

A process known as “Voice Banking”.

“An individual voice rather than a generic one is part of your identity and maybe that will make you treated more as more of an individual rather than the generic voice generated by machine’”

Synthesised speech production can be controlled by alternative input devices - i.e. eye trackers. \cite{elsahar2019augmentative}.
