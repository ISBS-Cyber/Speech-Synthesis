                %the act of typing out a phrase by hand is felt as a more intimate form of communication than predicted responses
                \item Uniformity of language - Person 12 \cite{Valencia2023}
                %"If the system [LLMs to expand text] is being used in the future, are all AAC users going to talk the same way?"

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Hard to use \cite{Valencia2023}
                %SS users have expressed how the Technological complexity of the systems along with the physical and mental effort of using them makes them hard to use. This often leads to a reduction in communication.
                \item Emotionless 
                %SS is still very much imperfect. Synthesised voices while improving every year, still lack the emotional expressiveness of the human voice. 
                \item Support of professionals \cite{cave2021, Jackson2025}
                %In Cave's study, it was found the professionals were often not very supportive of people with MND, trying to avoid discussion of late stage MND, and often providing little guidance for voice banking and SS. This creates a large barrier to entry for SS, and this harms many MND people in the long run as Jackson's paper shows an early introduction to SS is beneficial for psychosocial outcomes.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Retains identity
                %Many people with MND and their families agree it helps them retain a sense of their identity, having the voice sound like them. They express how banking their voice allows them to take control of this aspect of their identity.
                \item Predictive text \cite{Valencia2023}
                %Predictive text has been shown to be exceptionally useful to SS users, with 11/12 members in Valencia's study finding LLM augmented communication moderately or more useful. Although it acts as a partial solution to the difficulty of using SS devices, there are ethical concerns about privacy and practical concerns about the portability of LLMs. 
                \item Maintain connections \cite{cave2021, Leite2017}
                %It has also been shown that SS helps people with MND retain connections. This is extremely important as it has been shown that QoL directly decreases with voice deterioration.
