\begin{frame}{Perspectives from Speech Synthesis Users}
    Input 
        typing intimacy: the act of typing out a phrase by hand is felt as a more intimate form of communication than predicted responses by person 10 \cite{Valencia2023}
        Similarity: "If the system [LLMs to expand text] is being used in the future, are all AAC users going to talk the same way?" - person 12 \cite{Valencia2023}
        Effort to record: "I don't think it's worth it for the amount of time that I will live for" - person 10 \cite{Cave2021}
        Simplicity: "simple and dedicated to being your speaker with the right keypad no logging in no other apps" - person 4 \cite{cave2021}
    Output
        Preserving identity: "his disease is so so so dreadful it takes away everything ... The voice helps me retain something of me" - person 8 \cite{Cave2021}
        Taking control: "try to preserve a part of me" - person 7 \cite{cave2021}
        Too different to how they used to sound: "I don't really want my voice to come out synthetically and I don't really want it to come out as it is"  - person 3 \cite{Cave2021}
        Denial/not ready: "I didn't want to think about that yet" - person 9 \cite{Cave2021}
