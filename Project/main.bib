  abstract  = {Users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices sometimes find it difficult to communicate in real time with others due to the time it takes to compose messages. AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to support AAC users by improving the quality and variety of text suggestions. However, these technologies may fundamentally change how users interact with AAC devices as users transition from typing their own phrases to prompting and selecting AI-generated phrases. We conducted a study in which 12 AAC users tested live suggestions from a language model across three usage scenarios: extending short replies, answering biographical questions, and requesting assistance. Our study participants believed that AI-generated phrases could save time, physical and cognitive effort when communicating, but felt it was important that these phrases reflect their own communication style and preferences. This work identifies opportunities and challenges for future AI-enhanced AAC devices.},

  abstract       = {This perspective paper presents a first-person account of life with motor neurone disease (MND). Through the lens of lived experience, it explores the complex and often prolonged diagnostic journey, shaped in part by the protective grip of denial. This paper then delves into the emotional impact of MND on the individual and their close relationships, capturing the strain on identity and family dynamics. It also highlights the vital role of the multidisciplinary team in providing support throughout the journey. A central focus of the paper is the personal journey of voice banking. It reflects on the restorative experience of reclaiming a pre-disease voice through tools such as ElevenLabsTM. This narrative underscores the critical importance of early intervention and timely access to voice banking, positioning voice not only as a tool for communication but also as a powerful anchor of identity, dignity, and agency. The paper concludes by highlighting key systemic gaps in MND care. It calls for earlier referral to speech pathology, earlier access to voice banking, access to psychological support from the time of diagnosis, and better integration between research and clinical care.},
